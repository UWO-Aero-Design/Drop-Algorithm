# Drop-Algorithm

Machine Learning Course:
If you guys are interested in neural networks or logistic regression, check out the course below. It's free and pretty easy to follow, so even if you're a beginner you should be able to keep up.

Machine Learning Library for Python:
The machine learning library demoed in the code is found here. You need both the numpy and scipy libraries for this library to work.

Software to determine drop trajectory:
A team member from last year mentioned that this software could be used to track the payload after it is released from the plane.
